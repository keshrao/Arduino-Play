# Arduino-Play

Couple Arduino sketches to explore Arduino and accessories

## Cat Deterrent 
Uses sonar distance sensor to detect if object is close and if so, activate air pump. In real life use, the air pump was connected to water jet (i.e., windshield spray used in cars) and it drew water from a water tank. System was setup on the kitchen counter overnight. If the cat jumped on the counter or tried to get into the sink, it would get sprayed with water. The setup worked beautifully and the cat has since stopped going on the counters. 

## Watering Plant
Uses a moisture sensor, embedded into the soil of a potted plant to measure the water concentration of the soil and spray water if it got too dry. The water spray technique was the same as what was used for the Cat Deterrent system. Unfortunately, the moisture sensor was not effective as the soil was porous and water seemed through. The system overwatered the pot and there was a pool of water in the water catch. May be an issue with either the moisture sensor or the soil type.
